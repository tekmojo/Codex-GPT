# Resume Builder

This project demonstrates a resume builder built with Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, Auth.js, and PDFKit.

The app includes authentication, resume data stored in a Prisma database, and an API route that generates PDFs using PDFKit.

Due to environment restrictions, dependencies are not installed automatically. Install Node.js packages using `npm install` before running the app.
